## Pickle

Pickle is a YAPB enabled theme for wordpress originally based on Reflection and TwentyTen.

I created this theme because although I liked Reflection it does not support widgets or custom menus or posts which do not contain photos.

## Notes

There is still a lot of work to do on this theme so before you jump in expect the following to change:

  1. Will make full use of HTML5
  2. Simplification of HTML, CSS and JS
  3. Add theme option to remove all references to comments
  4. Add theme option to remove all references to EXIF data
