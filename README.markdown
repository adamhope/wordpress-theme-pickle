## Pickle

Pickle is a YAPB enabled theme for wordpress based on Reflection and TwentyTen.

I created this theme because although I liked Reflection it does not support widgets or custom menus or posts which do not contain photos.

## Notes

There is still a lot of work to do on this theme so before you jump in expect the following to change:

  1. Will make full use of HTML5
  2. Update admin settings for theme
  3. Simplification of HTML, CSS and JS
  4. Use minimised jQuery tooltip plugin
